# Pizza Bot

For this project, Katarina Torninger and Annika Melin created a pizza üçï bot, which first and foremost asks for user's name, then for your choice of pizza out of the 4 choices listed, the quantity and as a result, it prints out a message of approval or an error message - depending on your choice.

## The problem

We went about building this bot step-by-step.
Firstly, we solved all the iterations, commited the changes, and then we went onto styling.

The first three choices of our bot print an approved message taking the order, first printing out user's name then the type of pizza they ordered, the quantity, the total cost and the time it'll take to process the order.

If the user chooses "Margherita Pizza", the form will print out the message saying this pizza is out of stock. (We are aware that this is close to impossible that this type of pizza would be 'out of stock', but we just wanted to implement the fourth value and try it out)

We wanted to implement the pop-up images after the order has been places, but we didn't quite get there this time around. That would be the next step, as well as a timer.

We have even managed to reach some of the advanced goals.
